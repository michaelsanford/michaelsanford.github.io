# Changes from Dinesh's template

Being a polyglot developer _and human_, I added multi-language support.

The hero element is translated into the languages in which I feel like communicating.

But rather than just show one, for the extremely rare case in which a user has more than one language support configured, it will invoke a carousel-like behaviour and rotate among only the languages the user has claimed to support. This is the case for my browser.

I also hardened the security somewhat by adding a CSP, Feature Policy and an app manifest.
