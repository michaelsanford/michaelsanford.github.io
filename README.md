## L10n Support (sort of...)

Being a polyglot developer _and human_, I added multi-language support.

The hero element is translated into the languages in which I feel like communicating.

But rather than just show one, for the extremely rare case in which a user has more than one language support configured, it will invoke a carousel-like behaviour and rotate among only the languages the user has claimed to support. This is the case for my browser.

# CSP and FSP

I also hardened the security by adding a CSP and a Feature Policy. I also added an app manifest.

# Added Lighthouse Audit

Felt like adding [a Lighthouse audit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-lighthouse-in-github-actions/) to this as well,
becuase code quality speaks, right?
